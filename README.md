# Paul Dill libary crud app
***
## General Info
This project is a simple crud app that I'm building from scratch without the use of a tutorial.  The purpose of this app is to help me learn Node.js and MariaDB.  It's a simple library of books and authors.  I went with this basic idea because I have plenty of books to use as sample data to populate the database.
